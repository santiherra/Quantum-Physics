# Quantum-Physics
Repository dedicated to some exact or semi-exact solutions in Quantum Mechanics.

## Usage
To use this repository you must clone it and run the 'pip install -r requirements.txt' command so that you get all the required packages with the proper versions. 
You will find multiple Python scripts each dedicated to interactive plots about a determined Quantum System.

## Contents 
* Free Particles: Particles under null potentials
 - Quantum Wave Packet: Gaussian distribution
* Well Potentials: Particles under constant or infinite potential barriers
 - First N modes, infsq: Distributions made by the first N modes of oscillation in an infinite square well
 - Polynomial distribution: Wavefunction starting from $x^2(L-x)$ distribution in the infinite square well
